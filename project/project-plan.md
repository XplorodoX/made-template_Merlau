# Project Plan

## Title
Analysis of CO₂ Emissions in the Americas Over the Past Two Decades

## Main Question

1. How have CO₂ emissions changed over the last two decades in North and South America, and which countries are contributing the most to these changes?

## Description

Understanding the trends and contributors to CO₂ emissions in the Americas is crucial for developing effective climate policies. This project aims to analyze the changes in CO₂ emissions in North and South America over the past 20 years, identifying key contributing countries and sectors. By utilizing data from reputable sources, the study will provide insights into emission patterns and inform strategies for emission reduction.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Our World in Data
* Metadata URL: [CO₂ Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)
* Data URL: [Annual CO₂ Emissions by World Region](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region)
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides comprehensive information on annual CO₂ emissions by world region, including detailed data for North and South America.
