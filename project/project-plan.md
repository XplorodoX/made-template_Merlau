# Project Plan

## Title
Analysis of CO₂ Emissions in the Americas Over the Past Two Decades

## Main Question

1. How have CO₂ emissions changed over the last two decades in North and South America, and which countries are contributing the most to these changes?

## Description

Understanding the trends and contributors to CO₂ emissions in the Americas is crucial for developing effective climate policies. This project aims to analyze the changes in CO₂ emissions in North and South America over the past 20 years, identifying key contributing countries and sectors. By utilizing data from reputable sources, the study will provide insights into emission patterns and inform strategies for emission reduction.

## Datasources

### Datasource: World Development Indicators
- **Metadata URL:** [World Development Indicators](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712)
- **Data URL:** [World Development Indicators](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712)
- **Data Format:** CSV, Excel

**Description:**
The WDI dataset is compiled by the World Bank from officially recognized international sources. It provides a wide array of indicators, including CO₂ emissions, which are valuable for analyzing emission trends in North and South America over the past two decades. The data is disaggregated by country and year, facilitating detailed examination.

**Licensing:**
The data is available under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0)](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses), permitting copying, modification, and distribution, provided appropriate credit is given. 

**Integration into the Project:**
This dataset complements the already planned data sources, offering additional perspectives and validation opportunities for analyzing CO₂ emissions in the Americas. It is recommended to combine the data from the WDI dataset with existing data to ensure a more comprehensive and robust analysis. 

## Work Packages
